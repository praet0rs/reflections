What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new repository called .git is created with no stored commits. By creating .git, a new storage point for git is created in the repository directory which will enable version control of the files contained within that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a holding location in which files can be placed prior to them being committed.
